Copy the **Session Template** block below for each new session. Fill in the frame *before* you start, the close fields *after* you tag.

## Session Template

### Session N — [date]

**Frame** (fill in *before* starting — 2 minutes)
- Goal: what does done look like for this session?
- Out of scope: what am I explicitly not doing today?
- Failure condition: what would make this session a failure?

**Start time:** HH:MM

**RPI cycle**
- Research: `.copilot-tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-research.md`
- Plan: `.copilot-tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md`
- Changes: `.copilot-tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-changes.md`
- Review: `.copilot-tracking/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-review.md`

**Fit check** (after Plan, before Implement — 2 minutes)
- Will this plan fit in 90–120 min? (yes/no)
- Smallest cut if no:
- Decision: (proceed / cut: <what> / re-frame)

**During**
- Drift moments (threads I wanted to pull but didn't):
- Parking lot (revisit between sessions):

**Close ritual**
- [ ] Tests green
- [ ] FF-merge (`gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch`)
- [ ] Tag (`git tag X.Y.Z && git push origin X.Y.Z`)
- [ ] Repo memory updated
- [ ] Next session starter (one sentence — where does the next session begin?):

**End time:** HH:MM
**Total focus minutes:**
**Tag shipped:** X.Y.Z

**One-paragraph summary**
What I built · what I decided · what matters for next time.

**Health signal**
- Framing quality (1–5): did the frame hold?
- Drift (yes/no): did I leave scope?
- Fit check honest (yes/no): did I record a real decision, not a vibe?
- Close complete (yes/no): tests · merge · tag · memory · paragraph?

## Session 1 — 2026-05-06

**Frame**
- Goal: Walking skeleton in Go. Pick stack (Go + chi + slog + standard `net/http`), scaffold module, ship `/version`, `/healthz`, `/readyz` end-to-end on local k3s via Kustomize. Distroless multi-stage image, non-root (uid 1000), read-only root FS. Tag `0.1.0`.
- Out of scope: `/api/*` endpoints, data loading, validation, metrics, Prometheus/Grafana, OpenAPI/Swagger, NetworkPolicy, ServiceMonitor, benchmarks, Web Validate suite.
- Failure condition: image not running non-root with RO root FS; `/version` not returning a plain semver; cluster-side verification of all three endpoints not demonstrated; or scope creep into anything in "out of scope".

**Start time:** 18:05

**RPI cycle**
- Research: `.copilot-tracking/2026-05-06-stack-research.md`
- Plan: `.copilot-tracking/2026-05-06-skeleton-plan.md`
- Changes: `.copilot-tracking/2026-05-06-skeleton-changes.md`
- Review: `.copilot-tracking/2026-05-06-skeleton-review.md`

**Fit check**
- Will this plan fit in 90–120 min? yes
- Smallest cut if no: drop k3s deploy verification; ship Dockerfile + manifests un-applied
- Decision: proceed (host has k3s, docker, kubectl, kustomize already)

**During**
- Drift moments:
- Parking lot:

**Close ritual**
- [ ] Tests green
- [ ] FF-merge
- [ ] Tag
- [ ] Repo memory updated
- [ ] Next session starter:

**End time:**
**Total focus minutes:**
**Tag shipped:**

**One-paragraph summary**


**Health signal**
